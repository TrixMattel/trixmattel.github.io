This Github account has existed since before this lab, mostly for the Harvard CS50 Python course, which is why the username isn't my name. I will correct this with a new account if needed.


This repository has been created for Lab 1 and for commits on future projects.


To make this repository, I created a new repository in my browser, downloaded and logged into Github Desktop, and created a folder on my drive to clone the repository.

# About Me
I am 28, originally from Houston, TX, and moved to Clayton in 2022. I have two pets, one dog and one cat.
## My Interests
My stable interests are Big Brother, music, soccer, and football. I'm currently watching season 26 of Big Brother as it broadcasts, as well as keeping up on the live feeds (Angela stan). For music, I frequent forums for whatever genre or artist I'm delving into, and rely on (online) word of mouth for recent releases. Due to poor streaming archival for several albums I enjoy, I keep a local copy of all music I enjoy on my phone in an SD card.

Someone, somewhere, I'm sure.

More recent interests I've had are:
* News reading *(I consider this a hobby as I feel it takes effort to stay informed)*  
  * Has led into a very, very, **very** amateur interest in chip making technologies and methods.
 * Automotive engineering
 * Magic the Gathering
## Websites I Recommend

* [Joker's Updates](https://forums.jokersupdates.com/ubbthreads/quickview/bbupdates.php) 
  * For the fan that can't watch feeds all day, Joker's Updates are indispensable to keep up on the happenings in the Big Brother House.
* [Ford Truck Enthusiasts](https://www.ford-trucks.com/) 
  * For someone whose truck is almost as old as them, I find myself on these forums more often than I'd like to admit. 
* [Music-Map - The Tourist Map of Music](http://www.music-map.com)
	 * Type any artist into here and it gives you a litany of similar artists. Great for shaking up what you listen to if you're in a rut.
