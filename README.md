This Github account has existed since before this lab, mostly for the Harvard CS50 Python course, which is why the username isn't my name. I will correct this with a new account if needed.


This repository has been created for Lab 1 and for commits on future projects.


To make this repository, I created a new repository in my browser, downloaded and logged into Github Desktop, and created a folder on my drive to clone the repository.
